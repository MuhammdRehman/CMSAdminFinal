The system should streamline administrative control, enhance donation control, and improve transparency in charity operations.

# `ToolKit`
### As the database seems to realistically implemented we will be using “REACT JS” for front-end and for back-end, we will be using the “FIREBASE” 
### `REASON OF USING THEM:`
## We have used `REACT JS` because of its powerful rendering components approach. With the potential for our project to encompass multiple pages, React JS's modular structure ensures that we can write concise code while rendering a greater number of components, thereby enhancing code reusability and maintainability.
## Reason of using `FIREBASE` for back-end.As our project is realistically flexible and demands on time changes. Moreover FIREBASE is an online hosted database so our data will be preserved online and with REACT JS as front-end , users will be able to see changes on the spot. 

# `Packages to Install`
#### To run this projects you have to install some external node modules or packages.To continue of with this projects run these commands:
#### npm i firebase
#### npm i react-icons
#### npm i react-router-dom
#### npm i react-toastify 
#### npm i react-responsive-carousel

# `Test Cases`
### There are two files `insertProjects.jsx` And `insertCampaign.jsx` , they sort fo take a json array and that data to the fireabse.

## We have Hosted our sites on netlify as it is Free resource and Simple
## We need to make account on it and just drag and drop our projects build file
## However our project is realistically interactive so data has to be Real-time so that transpaerent action could take Place.
## To test the sites you can find Below links:
## [Aisaar-Client](https://aisaar.netlify.app).
## [Aisaar-AdminDashboard](https://admin-aisaar.netlify.app).
